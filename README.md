This repository contains different games I have made using Python

1. [Rock-Paper-Scissor Game](https://github.com/ArnabC27/python-games/blob/main/rock_paper_scissor.py) : Rock paper scissors is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock", "paper", and "scissors".<img src = 'https://miro.medium.com/max/800/1*8du96SQUQ0NlWmWvVu20Zw.png' height=100,width=200>
