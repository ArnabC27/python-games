This repository contains different games I have made using Python

1. [Rock-Paper-Scissor Game](https://github.com/ArnabC27/python-games/blob/main/rock_paper_scissor.py) <br>
   Rock paper scissors is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock", "paper", and "scissors".![L-1118477-1481560705-7565 jpeg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70847577/116782961-b6eb4900-aaa9-11eb-9566-4b22fd16dfd3.jpg)
   
2. [Snake Game](https://github.com/ArnabC27/python-games/blob/main/snake-game.py) <br>
   Snake is the common name for a video game concept where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle![h](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70847577/116796001-b62cd400-aaf6-11eb-9dca-af89d0dfa912.jpg)
